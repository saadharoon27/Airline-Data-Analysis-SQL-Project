## Project Overview
**A company** operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium–sized machines. They have been providing high-quality air transportation services to their clients for several years, and their primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, convenient journey for our passengers. However, they are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as **stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices**, and a tight labour market resulting in increased labour costs. As a result, the company’s **profitability** is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to **increase their occupancy rate**, which can help boost the **average profit earned per seat**.<br>
<br>
**Challenges**<br>
- **Stricter environmental regulations**: The demand on the airlines industry to decrease its carbon footprint is growing, which has resulted in more stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
- **Higher flight taxes**: To solve environmental issues and increase money, governments all around the world are taxiing aircraft more heavily, which raises the cost of flying and decreases demand.
- **Tight labour market resulting in increased labour costs**: The lack of trained people in the aviation sector has increased labour costs and increased turnover rates.
